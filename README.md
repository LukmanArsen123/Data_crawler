Introduction
This project implements an intelligent web crawler that can automatically extract, clean, and summarize web content. It integrates asynchronous web scraping, natural language processing, and large language model (LLM)-powered text cleaning. The goal is to build a system capable of retrieving high-quality information from websites, removing noise, and producing concise summaries.
